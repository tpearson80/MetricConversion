## Information about the program:
The Metric Conversion application was done using the Java programming language with the Eclipse IDE and some help with JavaFX design using Scene Builder. I chose to do this project because I believe this application can help some people that move here from around the world or some people that grew up here and are traveling abroad with understanding the conversions. This is my first time using JavaFX. I think adding some abbreviations for the measurements at the end of the output would help it become easier to read. Some of the numbers can become very large and formatting the numbers only goes so far. I would like to incorporate some more categories for conversion such as: currency, time, and energy. I think changing the current menus that I have with a menu bar going across the top of the screen and including a search bar so the user can search for the conversion methods would be more user friendly. 


## Directions on how to use the program:
### Step 1: Choose your category.
You can choose from 5 categories: Temperature, Weight, Length, Area, and Volume. Click on the menu underneath the category that you want.

### Step 2: Choose your conversion.
After you have chosen your category and clicked on the menu, scroll down to the conversion that you want to use and click on it. You will notice that the Convert From: label and the Convert To: label will now show which conversion you chose. Another thing you may notice is the default scale icon has changed to a different icon (unless you chose the weight category).
 
### Step 3: Type the amount that you want to convert.
Once you have chosen your category and what you want to convert, enter the amount that you want to convert under the Enter Amount Below label in the text box that says Enter Here.

### Step 4: Submit the amount.
You have typed the number for conversion and now you need to enter it. There are two ways to accomplish this:
1)	Hit the enter key on your computer.
2)	Click on the Submit button below the text box.

Now that you have submitted your entry, look below the Submit and Reset buttons to view the conversion output.

### Step 5: Switch the Convert From: and Convert To:
You can switch the Convert From: and Convert To: values with the switch button option. 

For Example: if you originally chose to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius and do not want to go back to the menu to change the conversion to Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can hit the switch button to accomplish this.

### Step 6: Reset Button.
Although it is not necessary to reset everything, as you can go to each menu as much as you want and the conversions will keep coming, you can reset everything by clicking on the Reset button.
